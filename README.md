# exercise-react-redux-customer-register

### Main

You will create a customer registration system. This system must consist of 4 pages.

- The first page should be **Home**. It must have a Link that allows the user to navigate to the login page.
- The second page will be the **Login** page. There must be 2 fields to get user data (email and password). After logging in, the user must be redirected to the **Registered customers** page.
- If the login is not done, that is, the user has manually changed the system link and gone to the registration or customer page, the only message displayed should be: "Login not made".
- The **Registered customers** page should list all customers. If there is no customer, the message "No registered customers" should appear on the screen, along with a button to go to the registration page. This button must remain on the screen even if there are customers.
- The registration page must contain 3 inputs, to get 3 customer data: name, age and email. A button should generate the registration. There should also be a button on the page that takes the user to the **Registered customers** page.
States that do not need to navigate to other components can be saved internally. All others must be trafficked via Redux.

### Bonus
You will implement functionality to the customer registration code.

- On the Registered Customers page, create a button that orders customers alphabetically from the name field. If the button is clicked again, the original order must be shown.
- Each register must be accompanied by a button with the text X. If the button is clicked, the registration must be deleted.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
